# STL-Standard-Template-Library
This repository contains C++ code for implementing various data structures in a custom Standard Template Library (STL). 
The code includes implementations of the following data structures:

Singly Linear Linked List: A singly-linked list where elements are connected in a linear manner. It provides operations for inserting and deleting elements at various positions, as well as counting and displaying elements.

Singly Circular Linked List: A singly-linked list with a circular connection, where the last element points back to the first. It supports similar operations to the singly linear linked list.

Doubly Linear Linked List: A doubly-linked list where elements are connected in both forward and backward directions. It provides operations for inserting and deleting elements at various positions, counting elements, and displaying the list.

Doubly Circular Linked List: A doubly-linked list with a circular connection, supporting similar operations to the doubly linear linked list.

The code is organized into classes for each data structure, with templated types to support various data types. It demonstrates the fundamental principles of linked list-based data structures and can serve as a valuable learning resource for those interested in data structures and C++ programming.
